# craftingFurnitureEXP
 
Uses Skyrims pre set keywords to dictate what furniture crafts what when activating to apply skill usage to a new patch over furniture. Will use new data from mods overriting skyrim's vanilla and DLC furniture, as well as new furniture added by mods using Skyrim's keywords.

Also allows you to add new keywords to the list manually in settings or get a premade keyword list inside the data folder ending with "_premadeList.json" without ".
